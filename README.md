# Robotic_arm_classifier
Following Nicholas Renotte's Youtube tutorial on Object Detection using TENSORFLOW we use a dataset of red and white ping pong balls. Our algorithm detects and classifies the ball with respect to its color and our arduino controlled robotic arm moves accordingly and puts the ball in the respective container.
